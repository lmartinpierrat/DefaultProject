        #
        #   - Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes with
        # dynamically-allocated memory.
        #   - Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.
        #   - Have operator= return a reference to *this.
        #   - Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.
        #   - Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operators.
        #   - Never overload &&, ||, or ,.

        # classes too.

        # In particular, instead of testing for equality, you should check to see
